## 2  Workflow: basics ----------------------------------

### 2.1 Coding basics -----------------------------------

1 / 200 * 30

(59 + 73 + 2) / 3

sin(pi / 2)

# create new objects with the assignment operator <-:
  
x <- 3 * 4

# combine multiple elements into a vector with c():
  
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# apply basic arithmetic on vectors which is applied to every element of of the vector:
  
primes * 2

primes - 1

# assignment statements have the same form:
  
object_name <- value

### 2.2 Comments -------------------------------------

# Comments can be helpful for briefly describing what the following code does.

# create vector of primes
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# multiply primes by 2
primes * 2

### 2.3 What’s in a name? ----------------------------------
# 1. Object names must start with a letter and can only contain 
#  - letters, 
#  - numbers, _, and .. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need to adopt a convention for multiple words. We recommend snake_case, where you separate lowercase words with _.
